# Demand Prioritization System

## Overview
This project implements a demand prioritization system using a combination of:
- **Graph Neural Networks (GNN)** for customer clustering
- **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** for inventory allocation
- **Generative AI** for demand simulation

## Installation
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run the main pipeline:
```sh
python main.py
```

## Project Structure
- `models/` - Machine learning models (GNN, RL, GenAI)
- `agents/` - Reinforcement Learning agent and Gym environment
- `utils/` - Data loading and visualization tools
- `data/` - Placeholder for dataset files
